# Approximate-Form-
Approximate form started with research of failed projects, looking into why it failed and come up with a solution. The research also included successful projects and gather all the necessary rules and ideas that helped formulate my research. I concluded the research with the ideas of scale, rotation, and repetition can either benefit or devalue a project if misused. Two projects that played a significant role in Approximate Form which are Digital Rustication by Andrew Manto, and the fine works of Louis Boull√©e. Approximate Form includes the ideas of scale, rotation, variation, smoothens and roughness as a ruleset and translate it to coding with python. This is where python scripting starts to take form. The script structure is to place cubes along a curve, and the curve can be shortened and change angles to create different iteration. With this simple change in values, we can get my, and quick iterations that can be used in architectural projects. This is the power of the script and python. 


Installation instructions:
download the rhi file named approximate"
you would need to install the file so you can access the command.
once installed, run Rhino 3d and type in the command: "approximant" 
you will be givin a few questions up top in the comment prompt area. 
enter values at you own likeing and hit enter.
